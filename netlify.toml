  # Netlify will build the Docker image itself; no build command needed.
  # If you want Netlify to build the image, you can use a Dockerfile in a subfolder.
  # Here we just tell Netlify to use the Dockerfile in the repo root.
  publish = "."   # not used for Docker, but required

[dev]
  # Optional: local dev mode using Netlify CLI
  command = "docker compose up --build"
